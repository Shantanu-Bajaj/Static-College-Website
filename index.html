                <p class="text-small-heading">“In a gentle way, you can shake the world.” With this philosophy and ideology of
                    Mahatma Gandhi, MGM established an educational trust in 1982 under the guidance of former Education
                    Minister Shri Kamalkishore Kadam and a group of founder members who are hard-core academicians and
                    visionaries. The Trust established its pioneering institute in the historical city of Aurangabad,
                    home to the heritage sites of Ajanta & Ellora but lacking in premiere educational institutes. For
                    more than four decades, Mahatma Gandhi Mission has blazed a trail of academic excellence and
                    state-of-the-art health care services. A strong dynamic institution that keeps pace with the demands
                    of the modern world, prominent locations and excellent education facilities makes MGM worthwhile and
                    an exciting choice for education. This institution is devoted to extensively impart education and
                    enable the students to stand on their own, strongly believing that “Literary education is of no
                    value if it is not able to build up a sound character.”</p>
                    <p class="text-small-heading">With the vision for imparting quality education MGM initiated a chain of institutes with a spectrum
                    ranging from primary schools to post graduate degrees. MGM has been instrumental in promoting
                    Classical Dance & Music, Art, Culture, Heritage and creativity for art seekers. The Trust has also
                    paid heed to the aspect of physical fitness by converting a vast expanse of land into an
                    ultra-modern facility catering to a multitude of sports. MGM’s lush green and serene campus is
                    conducive to create a peaceful learning atmosphere.</p>
                    <p class="text-small-heading">It has acquired the reputation of being one of the premiere educational & health services charitable
                    trust in India. In all, during this journey Mahatma Gandhi Mission has established its mark over 6
                    campuses having over 70 colleges, Institutions and Centers of Engineering, Architecture, Medical,
                    Nursing, Management, Computer Science, IT, Biotechnology, Liberal Arts, Science, Commerce, Fine
                    Arts, Performing Arts, Fashion Design, Mass Communication & Journalism, Film Arts and Photography.</p>
